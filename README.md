# LoadBalancer
Imitating the working of a Load Balancer used for servers and network traffic using the data structure - Queues
I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS TOPIC IN A SIMPLE YET EFFICIENT WAY.
I HAVE LIMITED THE NUMBER OF QUEUES WE HAVE TO 5, AND THE NUMBER OF LOADS IN EACH QUEUE TO 10.
I ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL QUEUE NUMBER 6 WHICH HANDLES LOADS WITH LESS VALUE.

SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CODE:

	1. WHEN A LOAD IS RECIEVED FROM THE CLIENT SIDE, load_balance(int load, queue *q_list[5], queue *queue_A)
	   FUNCTION CALCULATES AND ENQUEUES THE LOAD TO THE APPROPRIATE QUEUE DEPENDING ON WHICH QUEUE HAS	
	   LESSER LOAD SUM AND NUMBER OF LOADS.
     
	2. WHEN THE LOAD IS BETWEEN 0-5 IT GOES TO THE SPECIAL QUEUE CALLED QUEUE_A DEPENDING ON THE LOAD SUM 
	   ON IT AS WELL THE OTHER. IF IT'S LOAD SUM IS GREATER THAN ANTHER QUEUE, THEN EVEN THOUGH BEING A LESSER
	   VALUED LOAD, IT WILL ENQUEUE INTO THE OTHER QUEUE.
     
	3. IF ALL THE QUEUES ARE SUPPOSE FULL AND A NEW LOAD IS TO BE ADDED, WE HAVE TO UNLOAD THE QUEUE NECESSARILY.
	   WE HAVE A remove_load(queue *q) FUCNTION WHICH DEQUEUES THE QUEUE AFTER WHICH A NOTHER LOAD CAN BE ADDDED.
